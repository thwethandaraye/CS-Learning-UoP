# Exercise 2.2

# 1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3πr3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?

r = 5
V = (4 / 3) * 3.14159 * (r ** 3)
print(V)

# 2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount.
#    Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. 
#    What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?

# If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at
# tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?

# Exercise 3.1. Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter
# and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70
# of the display.
# Hint: Use string concatenation and repetition. Also, Python provides a built-in function called len
# that returns the length of a string, so the value of len('monty') is 5.

def right_justify(s):
    spaces = 70 - len(s)
    print(" " * spaces + s)

right_justify("Jaden is so cool, as the same time she is so handsome. I love Jaden!")

# Exercise 3.2. A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For
# example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:

def do_fouth(f):
    f()
    f()
    f()
    f()

def print_name():
    print("your name")

do_fouth(print_name)

# Exercise 3.3, 2. Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns.

lineA = "+" + "- " * 4 + "+" + "- " * 4 + "+" + "- " * 4 + "+" + "- " * 4 + "+"
